## New Features

### Misc Category
We are currently working on a miscellaneous category for tweaks and settings that don't fit in with anything else, such as the Battery Spoof tweak.

### Battery Spoofer
This will allow you to spoof your battery percentage to anything that you input. Devlog 2 introduces the feature of being able to reset the percentage back to normal. A further update will introduce being able to modify if it's detected by a charger or not.
