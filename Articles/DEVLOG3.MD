# Development Log #3 (2/28/23)
This is the third development log of NoLexa. Develoment logs are going to be tri-monthly, which means there will be around 3 development updates every month. This is to help keep transparency and to keep track of updates. This devlog doesn't introduce many new features as most of them are under the hood improvements.


## New Features

### Settings
There is now a settings button to access application settings where you can change where the default NoLexa directory is created, update checker, and more soon.


## What's New

### Remote Screen Recording
There is now an option to record the screen and stop it at anytime. Screen recordings will be sent to the ``Screencaps`` directory. I am unsure if being able to remotely VIEW your screen in a window will be possible though.

### Battery Spoofer Update
You can now spoof if your device is plugged in on the charger or is not on a charger. Pressing ``Reset`` will change it back to normal.


### Interface Overhaul
We are slowly rolling out a new interface which adds categories, a consistent theme, and more.

The old interface used to look like this

### Dump to Text
You can now dump system information to text, and they will be neatly organized depending on what type of dump it is.

### Remote ADB Shell
You can now access an ADB shell directly from NoLexa! This feature is quite self-explanitory.

## What's Next
Currently I have plans to add a way to view all installed packages with the 'Package Manager' and uninstall them accordingly. I also have plans to fully imploment the backup customization option so you don't have to backup your device 100% every time.
