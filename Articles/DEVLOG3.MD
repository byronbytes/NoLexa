# Development Log #3 (2/13/23)
This is the third development log of NoLexa. Develoment logs are going to be tri-monthly, which means there will be around 3 development updates every month. This is to help keep transparency and to keep track of updates.

## New Features

### Settings
There is now a settings button to access application settings where you can change where the default NoLexa directory is created, update checker, and more soon.


## What's New

### Interface Overhaul
