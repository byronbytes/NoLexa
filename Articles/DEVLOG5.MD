# Development Log #5 (4/10/23)
This is the fifth development log of NoLexa. This devlog focuses more towards code readability and setting up a better code environment.

## What's New

#### Organization
All ADB functions that AREN'T calls to the device (such as remotely installing ADB) are now put in the NoLexa.ADB library. I am working on a neater
and better organized way to keep classes and methods clean. This also allows for multiple form support.

#### UI Tweaks
Minimal UI tweaks to the ADB setup page.


## New Features

#### Remove Lockscreen Ads
There will be a feature that removes advertisements from your lockscreen which is still being worked on and may need the device to be rooted.

#### Brightness Modifier
Small tweak that modifies your brightness level.
