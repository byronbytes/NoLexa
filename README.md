# NoLexa
A multi-purpose tweaking tool to remove Amazon Alexa from your device for good. **NoLexa will be available for testing in the Summer of 2022 due to other projects getting in the way and the complexity of this project.**

## Why?
No one likes Amazon Alexa. It's been proven multiple times that Alexa listens to your conversations and sends the data to Amazon without your knowledge or consent. There is no complete way to delete Alexa, and the best you can do is disable it in the software, which still leaves a lot of unwanted traces. This is where NoLexa comes in handy. 

My mom is an avid hater against Alexa and even went as far as to drill out the microphone in the FireTV to prevent Alexa from listening in. My mom wanted to remove Alexa from the Kindle because in newer updates, it got more intrusive. So this is what gave me the idea to create this.

## Support
You may donate if this application has helped you, donating can help me develop better software for everyone to use, and it would be very appreciated. Even $1 makes a huge difference. These funds would go to better development of other projects such as Tasks, NoLexa, and LiteTools as a business. There are different options of donating such as Patreon and PayPal.

## FAQ

Q: Why is NoLexa **not** open sourced yet?

A: I believe in keeping software open sourced, but this application is experimental, and I want to keep this private until it's fully stable. There also could be legal issues, which I'm trying to avoid, but I'm here to express freedom for others.
