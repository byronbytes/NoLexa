# NoLexa
A multi-purpose tweaking tool to remove Amazon Alexa from your device for good. NoLexa will be available for beta testing in the Spring of 2023.

## Why?
**No one likes Amazon Alexa.** It's been proven multiple times that Alexa listens to your conversations and sends the data to Amazon without your knowledge or consent. There is no complete way to delete Alexa, and the best you can do is disable it in the software, which still leaves a lot of unwanted traces. This is where NoLexa comes in handy. 

My mom is an avid hater against Alexa and even went as far as to drill out the microphone in the FireTV to prevent Alexa from listening in. She wanted to remove Alexa completely from the Kindle because in newer updates it got more intrusive and would keep on enabling after disabling it.

## FAQ

Q: Why is NoLexa **not** open sourced yet?

A: I believe in keeping software open source, but this application is a very experimental stage and I want to keep this private until it's fully stable. There also could be legal issues, which I'm trying to avoid, but I'm here to express freedom for others.
